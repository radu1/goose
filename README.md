# GOOSE 
## (a framework for encrypted Graph OutsOurcing and SPARQL Evaluation)

This repository contains the open-source code of GOOSE and scripts that allow to reproduce the experimental results from our paper.

The script `install-libraries.sh` installs Python 3 and the necessary libraries for GOOSE, but also Java (needed for SPARQL evaluation using [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/)) and C++ (needed for [gMark](https://github.com/graphMark/gmark) graph and query workload generation).
