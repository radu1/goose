# GOOSE 
## (a framework for encrypted Graph OutsOurcing and SPARQL Evaluation)

This repository contains the open-source code of GOOSE and scripts that allow to reproduce the experimental results from our paper.

GOOSE is written in Python, and uses [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) (written in Java) for SPARQL evaluation and [gMark](https://github.com/graphMark/gmark) (written in C++) for graph and query workload generation.
